I want to understand the project file by file and line by line in the main code (not in the template folder), including how it works and how sessions are managed.

Overview
To help you understand the "All-in-One-Planner" project, I will analyze each Python file in the main codebase, excluding the template folder. I’ll provide a detailed, line-by-line explanation of the main application file (app.py), followed by other Python files (models.py, config.py, birthday_scheduler.py, birthday_scheduler copy.py, moive.py, and test_db_connection.py). Special attention will be given to session management and how the components work together. Let’s begin with app.py.

File: app.py - The Core of the Application
app.py is the central part of the Flask web application. It initializes the Flask app, defines URL routes, and handles the core logic, including user authentication, session management, and application features.
1. Initialization and Configuration

Lines 1–16: Import necessary libraries and modules:

Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for, flash, session: Core Flask components for web functionality.
Flask-SQLAlchemy: Simplifies database operations with SQLAlchemy.
config.Config: Imports the Config class from config.py for application settings.
models: Imports database models (db, Task, Birthday, MovieAlert, User) from models.py.


Lines 18–22:

app = Flask(__name__): Creates a Flask application instance.
app.config.from_object(Config): Loads configuration settings (e.g., database URI, secret key) from the Config class.
db.init_app(app): Initializes SQLAlchemy with the Flask app.
with app.app_context(): db.create_all(): Creates database tables based on models in models.py if they don’t exist.



2. User Authentication and Session Management
This section explains how the application identifies and tracks users across requests using Flask’s session mechanism.

/register Route (Lines 29–55):

Handles user registration.
When a user submits the registration form (request.method == 'POST'), it retrieves the username, email, and password.
Checks if the username or email already exists in the database.
If unique, creates a User object and saves it to the database.


/login Route (Lines 57–72):

Handles user login.
Retrieves username and password from the login form.
Queries the database for a matching username.
Session Creation: If credentials are valid, it creates a session:
pythonsession['user_id'] = user.id
session['username'] = user.username

How Sessions Work: Flask’s session object stores user data (e.g., user_id) in a cryptographically signed cookie sent to the user’s browser. The SECRET_KEY (from config.py) signs the cookie to prevent tampering. On subsequent requests, the browser sends the cookie back, and Flask verifies the signature to access the session data, allowing the app to "remember" the logged-in user.


/logout Route (Lines 75–79):

Logs the user out by clearing the session:
pythonsession.clear()

This removes all session data, requiring the user to log in again for protected routes.


login_required Decorator (Lines 110–117):

A security function applied to routes (e.g., /dashboard) to ensure only logged-in users can access them.
Checks if user_id exists in the session. If not, redirects to /login.
Prevents unauthorized access to protected pages.



3. Application Features (Tasks, Birthdays, Movies)
The remaining routes handle the planner’s core features, all protected by @login_required to ensure only authenticated users can access them.

General Pattern:

Routes use session['user_id'] to filter data, ensuring users only see their own tasks, birthdays, or movie alerts.
Example: /tasks Route (Lines 127–146):

Creates new tasks with user_id=session['user_id'].
Retrieves tasks with Task.query.filter_by(user_id=session['user_id']).all().


Similar logic applies to /birthdays and /movies routes, maintaining user-specific data isolation.



Summary of app.py
app.py sets up a Flask web application where users can register, log in, and manage tasks, birthday reminders, and movie alerts. The session mechanism, using a signed cookie with SECRET_KEY, securely tracks user identity across requests, ensuring personalized and protected access to data.

File: models.py - Defining the Database Structure
models.py defines the database schema using SQLAlchemy’s ORM. Each class represents a table, and attributes represent columns.

Line 2: Imports SQLAlchemy from flask_sqlalchemy.
Line 4: Creates a SQLAlchemy instance (db) used across the project.
Models:

User Model (Lines 6–13):

Table: users
Columns: id (primary key), username (unique, non-null), email (unique, non-null), password.


Task Model (Lines 15–23):

Table: tasks
Columns: id (primary key), title, description, due_date, user_id (foreign key linking to users.id).
Ensures tasks are tied to a specific user.


Birthday Model (Lines 25–39):

Table: birthdays
Columns: id, name, date_of_birth, subject, message, email, user_id (foreign key).
Includes a relationship to access the associated User.


MovieAlert Model (Lines 41–48):

Table: movies
Columns: id, movie details, user_id (foreign key).
Links movie alerts to users.





Summary of models.py
models.py defines the database structure, ensuring data is organized and user-specific via foreign keys. This supports the session-based data isolation in app.py.

File: config.py - Application Configuration
config.py centralizes configuration settings for the Flask app, database, and session security.

Line 1: Imports os for generating a random secret key.
Line 3: Defines the Config class.
Key Settings:

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI (Line 4):

'postgresql://postgres:python@localhost:5432/planner_db'
Specifies the PostgreSQL database connection (username: postgres, password: python, host: localhost, port: 5432, database: planner_db).


SECRET_KEY (Line 5):

os.urandom(24)
A random 24-byte string used to sign session cookies, ensuring session security.
Note: In production, use a fixed key (e.g., via environment variables) to persist sessions across app restarts.


SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS (Line 6):

Set to False to disable unnecessary object tracking, improving performance.


Email Settings (Lines 8–12):

EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_USE_TLS: Configures email services for notifications (used by scheduler scripts).





Summary of config.py
config.py provides essential settings for database connectivity, session security (SECRET_KEY), and email notifications. The SECRET_KEY is critical for secure session management.

File: birthday_scheduler.py - Background Birthday Email Scheduler
This standalone script runs independently of the web app to send automated birthday emails.
1. Imports and Setup (Lines 1–16)

Imports modules for dates (datetime), email sending (smtplib, email.mime), scheduling (apscheduler), and database access (models, config, flask).
Lines 12–15: Creates a minimal Flask app to provide application context for database and config access.

2. Email Validation (Lines 18–21)

is_valid_email: Uses a regular expression to validate email addresses, preventing errors during email sending.

3. Core Logic: send_birthday_emails (Lines 23–70)

Runs within an application context (with app.app_context()).
Lines 26–33:

Gets the current date.
Queries the Birthday table for entries where date_of_birth matches today’s day and month.


Lines 35–69 (Loop):

Iterates through matching birthdays.
Validates recipient email.
Creates an email using MIMEMultipart with data from the Birthday record.
Sends the email using the user’s email credentials (birthday.user_email, birthday.user_password) from the database.

Security Concern: Storing user email passwords in the database is risky.


Deletes the Birthday record after sending to prevent duplicate emails.



4. Scheduling (Lines 72–86)

Uses BackgroundScheduler to run send_birthday_emails every minute (minutes=1).
In production, this should be adjusted to run once daily (e.g., trigger="cron", hour=8).
atexit.register: Ensures graceful scheduler shutdown.
Lines 88–95: A while True: time.sleep(1) loop keeps the script running.

How It Fits
This script runs continuously, querying the database for birthdays and sending emails independently of user sessions. It relies on the database structure from models.py and email settings from config.py.

File: birthday_scheduler copy.py - Revised Birthday Scheduler
This is a more secure version of birthday_scheduler.py.

Key Difference:

Uses a single email account (Config.EMAIL_USER, Config.EMAIL_PASS) from config.py to send all emails, avoiding the storage of user email credentials in the database.


Recommendation: Use this version in production for better security.


File: moive.py - Movie Alert Checker (Incomplete)
This script aims to check movie release dates via The Movie Database (TMDB) API and send alerts, but it’s non-functional due to several issues.
1. Intended Functionality

fetch_movie_from_tmdb (Lines 7–16):

Queries the TMDB API to fetch movie details using a movie name and API key.


check_movies_in_db (Lines 18–36):

Retrieves Movie records with alert_sent == False.
Checks each movie’s release date via TMDB.
Sends an email if the release date is today or past and updates alert_sent to True.


send_email (Lines 38–41):

Placeholder function (only prints a message, not implemented).



2. Issues

Incorrect Import: Imports Movie instead of MovieAlert from models.py.
Hardcoded API Key: Uses an invalid/example TMDB API key.
Incomplete Email Function: send_email lacks actual email-sending logic.
No Scheduler: Runs once and exits, unlike birthday_scheduler.py.
File Name Typo: Named moive.py instead of movie.py.

Summary of moive.py
This script is a work in progress. To make it functional, fix the model import, use a valid TMDB API key, implement the send_email function, and add a scheduler like in birthday_scheduler.py.

File: test_db_connection.py - Database Connection Test
A utility script to verify the database connection.

Lines 1–2: Imports SQLAlchemy functions.
Line 4: Defines the same DATABASE_URI as in config.py.
Lines 6–12:

Attempts to connect to the database using create_engine.
Executes SELECT 1 to test the connection.
Prints success or error messages.



Summary of test_db_connection.py
This script is a standalone tool for debugging database connectivity issues, independent of the Flask app or sessions.

Project Summary and Workflow
The "All-in-One-Planner" project combines a Flask web application with background schedulers for a personalized planner experience.

Web Application (app.py, models.py, config.py, templates/):

Users register and log in via /register and /login routes.
Session Management: Flask stores user_id in a signed cookie using SECRET_KEY, enabling secure, user-specific access to tasks, birthdays, and movie alerts.
The @login_required decorator ensures only authenticated users access protected routes.
Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database, with models ensuring user-specific data isolation via user_id foreign keys.


Schedulers (birthday_scheduler.py, moive.py):

Birthday Scheduler: Runs continuously, sending birthday emails based on database records, independent of user sessions.
Movie Scheduler: Intended to send movie release alerts but requires fixes to be functional.


User Workflow:

A user registers and logs in, creating a session with their user_id.
They add tasks, birthdays, or movie alerts, stored in the database with their user_id.
The background scheduler (birthday_scheduler.py) checks for birthdays daily and sends emails using configured credentials.
The moive.py script (once fixed) would similarly check movie release dates and send alerts.




Key Insights on Session Management

Flask Sessions: The session object uses a signed cookie (via SECRET_KEY) to track user identity across requests. This allows the app to associate requests with a specific user_id, ensuring users only access their own data.
Security: The SECRET_KEY in config.py is critical for session integrity. In production, use a fixed key via environment variables.
Separation of Concerns: The web app (app.py) handles user interactions, while schedulers (birthday_scheduler.py, moive.py) operate independently, accessing the database directly without relying on sessions.
